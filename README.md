`archivy-pocket` allows users to sync their pocket bookmarks to their [Archivy](https://github.com/archivy/archivy) knowledge base.

It is an official extension developed by [archivy](https://github.com/archivy/)

![demo](https://github.com/archivy/archivy_pocket/blob/master/demo.gif)

## Install

You need to have `archivy` already installed.

Run `pip install archivy_pocket`.

## Usage

To do this, you need to create a Pocket API app [here](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/). It only needs the `Retrieve` permissions and is of type `Web`.

Then, run:

```python
archivy pocket auth <your pocket key>
```

This will prompt a webpage asking you to allow the Pocket App to retrieve your bookmarks. Click accept.

Run `archivy pocket complete` to finish up the auth process.


Now that you're setÂ up, all you need to do to is run `archivy pocket sync` to fetch your latest bookmarks.


If a previous sync did not terminate fully or you lost old bookmarks, run `archivy pocket sync --force` instead. This will reload all bookmarks from pocket and check if they are in your knowledge base. Otherwise, the plugin simply fetches the most recent ones, by checking to see which bookmark is the newest in your instance.

You can also use the plugin through the web interface at `/plugins`.
